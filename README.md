Read me. Reeeaadd Me. READ. ME.

Look at you. Look at what've you become. You manage to even stumble to a very remote and empty repository.

What do you think is the meaning of this?

Does this simply mean that you're just simply bored and have nothing to do else?

But seriously, who the fuck lurks on repositories.

I think you're looking for something else.

Maybe a potential.

Maybe there's even more than just saying greetings to the world.

Maybe you're one of the few people who actually has hope for the humanity.

I think you're goddamn right.

We'll see, maybe we can make something bigger than this..
